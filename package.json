  "description": "Clean 'private' support for JavaScript.\n\
   This library contains classes and utilities that will allow you to add 'privates' to your JavaScript classes in a clean, \
   spec-compliant way. This library will work both within a browser environment and node.js. It was created in order to \
   make it easier for a distributed team of developers to handle privates in a consistent way. The library is based on \
   JavaScript prototypes in order to avoid repetitive creation of functions.",
